# popular-movies 

Udacity Developing Android Apps project.  This is an application that show a list of movies by querying the TMDB.org api.

Note: in order for the application to work, you must register for TMDB.org api key.  The application looks for a string value resource call tmdb_api_key.  The application will not run unless this string key is created with a valid api key.
